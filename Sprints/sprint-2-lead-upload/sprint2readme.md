# Outreach App â€” Sprint 2 Documentation

ðŸ“¥ Lead Upload & Inbox Module

Sprint 2 adds lead management features to the Outreach App. Users can upload leads via CSV, tag them, and view/filter their leads in an inbox. The upload process is robust, supporting any column order and extra columns, as long as the headers include "email", "name", and "company".

| email    | TEXT    | Lead's email address           |
| name     | TEXT    | Lead's name                    |
| company  | TEXT    | Lead's company                 |
| tag      | TEXT    | User-supplied tag for grouping |
| user_id  | INTEGER | Foreign key to users table     |


## Features

1. **Upload Leads (upload-leads.php)**
   - Requires login.
   - Accepts CSV file and a tag.
   - CSV can have columns in any order; only "email", "name", and "company" are used.
   - Extra columns are ignored.
   - Validates email and required fields.
   - On success, redirects to My Leads with a success message.

2. **View, Edit, Delete, and Archive Leads (my-leads.php, edit-lead.php)**
   - Requires login.
   - Shows only the logged-in user's leads.
   - Filter by tag and search by name/company.
   - Select one or more leads to delete or archive (bulk actions).
   - Edit any lead's details (name, email, company, tag) via the Edit link.
   - Archived leads are hidden from the main inbox.
   - Displays a message if no leads are found or after upload/action.

3. **Security & Validation**
   - All user input is sanitized.
   - Only valid leads are inserted (no duplicates for same user).
   - Prepared SQL statements prevent SQL injection.

## Usage

- Run `db/leads-db.php` once to create the leads table if not already present.
- Use the dashboard to access upload and inbox features after login.
- For CSV upload, ensure headers include "email", "name", and "company" (case-insensitive, partial match allowed).
- Use the checkboxes and action buttons in My Leads to delete or archive leads.
- Use the Edit link to update lead details.
